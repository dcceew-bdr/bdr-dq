# Biodiversity Data Repository (BDR) Data Quality (DQ)

This repository will soon contain criteria, use cases and queries for data quality scenarios for data that will be housed within the BDR.

Since the BDR uses the [ABIS data model](https://linked.data.gov.au/def/abis/spec), these criteria, use cases and queries are presented here, in the AusBIGG GitHub organisation as the work will be relevant for all ABIS data, ot just the BDR.
