# Assess Geospatial Accuracy Precision
# --------------------------------------------------------
# What does this do?
# This query checks how accurate a coordinate is, based on its "uncertainty" value.
# "Uncertainty" means how far off (in meters) the coordinate might be from the real location.
#
# How do we decide the accuracy level?
# - If uncertainty is more than 10,000 meters OR if it is missing → "low_precision"
# - If uncertainty is 10,000 meters or less → "high_precision"
#
# Definitions:
# - low_precision: The location is not very accurate (missing or more than 10,000 meters).
# - high_precision: The location is quite accurate (10,000 meters or less).
