# Data Quality Criteria

This directory will soon contain criteria & use cases for the data quality scenarios tested by this bdr-dq tool. 

Since the BDR uses the [ABIS data model](https://linked.data.gov.au/def/abis), these criteria, use cases and queries are presented here, in the AusBIGG GitHub organisation as the work will be relevant for all ABIS data, not just the BDR.

These criteria are maintained by the BDR Team:

## General data quality checks
A set of fundamental quality checks and assertions that would be universally applicable regardless of the intended use case of the data.   

(Forthcoming)

## Fitness-for-purpose checks: a Species Distribution Modelling use case
Occurrences that have been curated and are available for users may or may not be fit for specific purposes, such as species distrbution modelling (SDM) as an example use case. For each identified use-case, there will be a set of defined quality criteria that will determine the fitness-for-purpose (FFP) of the data for that use case. 

An SDM FFP profile is being developed to test and classify data against.
