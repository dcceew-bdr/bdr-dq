# Data Quality Criteria

This directory will soon contain criteria & use cases for the data quality scenarios tested by this bdr-dq tool. 

Since the BDR uses the [ABIS data model](https://linked.data.gov.au/def/abis), these criteria, use cases and queries are presented here, in the AusBIGG GitHub organisation as the work will be relevant for all ABIS data, not just the BDR.

These criteria are maintained by the BDR Team:
