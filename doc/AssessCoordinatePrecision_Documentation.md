## Documentation for `assess_coordinate_precision()` Method

### Overview

The `assess_coordinate_precision()` method in the `RDFDataQualityAssessment` class evaluates the precision of geographical coordinates within an RDF graph. This method aims to determine the detail level of latitude and longitude values represented in the data.

### Usage

To call this method, you must have an instance of the `RDFDataQualityAssessment` class initialized with an RDF graph. Here's how to use the method:

```python
# Assuming rdf_assessor is an instance of RDFDataQualityAssessment
rdf_assessor.assess_coordinate_precision()
```

### How It Works

This method iterates over all geographical coordinates specified in the RDF graph. For each coordinate, it extracts the longitude and latitude, then assesses the number of decimal places to determine the precision:

- **High Precision:** More than 4 decimal places.
- **Medium Precision:** Between 2 and 4 decimal places.
- **Low Precision:** Less than 2 decimal places.

The precision assessment is based on the assumption that more decimal places in the coordinate values lead to higher precision and therefore more accurate location data.

### Example

```python
from rdflib import Graph

# Initialize the RDF graph
graph = Graph().parse("location_data.ttl", format="ttl")

# Create an instance of the assessor
rdf_assessor = RDFDataQualityAssessment(graph)

# Perform the coordinate precision assessment
rdf_assessor.assess_coordinate_precision()

# Output precision results
for result in rdf_assessor.result_matrix_df.itertuples():
    print(result)
```

### Conclusion

The `assess_coordinate_precision()` method provides a useful tool for determining the precision of geographical data within RDF datasets. It helps in understanding the granularity of location data, which is crucial for tasks requiring high spatial accuracy, such as mapping and geospatial analysis.
